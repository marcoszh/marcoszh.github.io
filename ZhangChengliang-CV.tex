% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.

% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be

% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the

\section{Research Interests}
My interests cover \textbf{big data analytics systems} and \textbf{cloud computing}, with a special focus on \textbf{machine learning systems}. I enjoy identifying system design, performance, and privacy issues in large-scale ML systems for both training and inference, and searching for general and efficient solutions.
